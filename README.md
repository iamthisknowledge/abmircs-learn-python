## Overview

### The goal

I AM:

- [x] I AM confident in outputting data and program flow. I can print to the console, use comments and format strings with ease.
- [x] I AM proficient in using strings and variables. I can assign values to variables, concatenate strings and slice and index strings with skill.
- [x] I AM capable of performing arithmetic operations and comparisons. I can do basic math operations, use operators and operands and compare values with relational operators.
- [x] I AM knowledgeable in using lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries. I can create and access collections of data, add, remove and modify elements and use methods and functions on collections.
- [x] I AM adept in using conditionals: if and elif. I can use if statements to control the flow of the program, use elif statements to add more conditions and use logical operators to combine conditions.
- [x] I AM skilled in using while and for loops. I can use while loops to repeat a block of code until a condition is met, use for loops to iterate over a sequence of values and use break and continue statements to control the loop execution.
- [x] I AM masterful in using functions and return statements. I can define and call functions to reuse code, pass arguments and parameters to functions and return values from functions with return statements.
- [x] I AM creative in using objects, classes and inheritance. I can create and use objects to model real-world entities, define and inherit from classes to create custom types and use methods and attributes to define the behavior and state of objects.
- [x] I AM clever in using list and dictionary comprehensions and lambda functions. I can use list comprehensions to create lists in a concise way, use dictionary comprehensions to create dictionaries in a concise way and use lambda functions to create anonymous functions on the fly.
- [x] I AM resourceful in using modules. I can import and use modules to access external code libraries, create and use my own modules to organize my code and explore the built-in modules in Python standard library.

## My process

- I achieved a high level of excellence on all lessons throughout this learning journey with Python, acing all assessments. I verified my skills using their [page](https://scrimba.com/learn/python/) and created this page from scratch on my own using the knowledge acquired.
